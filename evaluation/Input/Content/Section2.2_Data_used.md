### 2.2.1 In vitro / physicochemical data

A literature search was performed to collect available information on physicochemical properties of sufentanil. The obtained information from literature is summarized in the table below, and is used for model building.

| **Parameter**   | **Unit**    | **Literature value (reference)** | **Description**                                  |
| :-------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| MW              | g/mol       | 386.6 ([Zhou 2017](#5-references))  | Molecular weight                                 |
| pKa             |             | 8 ([Zhou 2017](#5-references)) | Base dissociation constant                       |
| Solubility (pH) | mg/L        | 0.076 (7) ([Roy 1988](#5-references)) | Solubility                                       |
| logP            |             | 3.95 ([Zhou 2017](#5-references))   | Partition coefficient between octanol and water  |
| fu              |             | 0.075 ([Zhou 2017](#5-references))  | Fraction unbound                                 |
| CLr*            | L/h         | 1 ([Zhou 2017](#5-references))      | Renal clearance                                  |
| CYP3A4 CLint* | Âµl/min/pmol | 20.74 ([Zhou 2017](#5-references))  | Cytochrome-P450 3A4 mediated intrinsic clearance |

*CLr and CYP3A4int parameters are built in PK-Sim as glomerular filtration (GF) and CYP3A4 - first order intrinsic clearance, respectively.

### 2.2.2 Clinical data

A literature search was performed to collect available clinical data on sufentanil in adults. 

The following publications were found in adults for model building and evaluation:

| Publication                       | Study description                                            |
| :-------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Bovill 1984](#5-references) | The pharmacokinetics of sufentanil in elective surgical patients, without hepatic or renal dysfunction. |
| [Willsie 2015](#5-references) | Pharmacokinetic properties of single- and repeated-dose sufentanil sublingual tablets in healthy volunteers. |
| [Taverne 1992](#5-references) | Comparative absorption and distribution pharmacokinetics of intravenous and epidural sufentanil in elective surgical patients, without hepatic or renal dysfunction. |
