The presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of a PBPK model for sufentanil in adults.

Sufentanil is a potent synthetic opioid. Like other opioids, sufentanil creates a stable hemodynamic environment in cardiovascularly compromised pediatric patients. Sufentanil has a high lipid solubility, which accounts for the fast onset when given intravenously. The commercial solution comes as preservative‐free sufentanil citrate, injectable with a pH of 4.5–7.0 (Jansen‐Cilag AB, Sweden). Sufentanil is solely metabolised by CYP3A4. Due to the high hepatic extraction ratio, for the overall clearance of sufentanil both CYP3A4 values as well as liver blood flow rate play dominant roles in the elimination in adult populations. The final sufentanil model applies metabolism by CYP3A4 and glomerular filtration and adequately described the pharmacokinetics of sufentanil in adults.

The sufentanil model is a whole-body PBPK model, allowing for dynamic translation between individuals. The sufentanil report demonstrates the level of confidence in the sufentanil PBPK model build with the OSP suite with regard to reliable predictions of sufentanil PK in adults during model-informed drug development.
