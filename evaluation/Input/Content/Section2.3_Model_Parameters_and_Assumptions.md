### 2.3.1 Absorption

Only intravenous data was available for model building.

### 2.3.2 Distribution

Plasma protein binding of sufentanil, related to the alpha acid glycoprotein concentration is approximately 93% in healthy males as described in the drug-label for intravenous administration ([FDA drug label](#5-References)). The fraction unbound (fu) of Vancomycin is built-in as 0.075 as also reported by Zhou et al. ([Zhou 2017](#5-References)).

After testing the available organ-plasma partition coefficient and cell permeability calculation methods built in PK-Sim, observed clinical data was best described by choosing the partition coefficient calculation method by Schmitt, and PK-Sim standard cell permeability calculation method. Specific organ permeability normalized to surface area was automatically calculated by PK-Sim.

### 2.3.3 Metabolism and Elimination

Sufentanil is solely metabolised by CYP3A4. Due to the high hepatic extraction ratio, for the overall clearance of sufentanil both CYP3A4 values as well as liver blood flow rate play dominant roles in the elimination in adult populations. The final sufentanil model applies metabolism by CYP3A4 and glomerular filtration and adequately described the pharmacokinetics of sufentanil in adults.
