The final sufentanil PBPK model applies elimination by CYP3A4 and glomerular filtration and adequately describes the pharmacokinetics of sufentanil in adults receiving SD of sufentanil ranging from 15µg to 355.5µg intravenously. 

This model could be applied for the investigation of drug-drug interactions (DDI), and translation to special populations such as pediatrics with regard to CYP3A4 based elimination.
