The PBPK model for **sufentanil** was developed with clinical pharmacokinetic data covering intravenous administration with a dose range of 15 up to 355.5µg (based on a mean patient body weight of 71.5kg receiving 5µg/kg dose), including SD clinical data. 

During the model-fitting, the following parameters were estimated (all other parameters were fixed to reported values):

* Lipophilicity
* CYP3A4 First order intrinsic clearance

The fit resulted in an adequate description of the clinical data. In contrast to the PK data derived from Bovill et al.  ([Bovill 1984](#5-References)) and Willsie et al. ([Willsie 2015](#5-References)), the extracted mean concentrations by Taverne et al. ([Taverne 1992](#5-References)) from the reported figure was slight overpredicted. As the individual data in the reported figure could not be properly extracted and showed considerable variability, it may be that the mean values included outliers and therefore be biased. As only limited amount of data was available, more available data could be used to further evaluate the model performance.

Overall the model results show that the PBPK model of sufentanil adequately described the data for intravenous administration for single dose.
